# ArtworkLayerDTO
#
# An ArtworkLayerDTO resembles a single layer of an Artwork
#
# This is *not* a product part
# A layer resembles a color or a specific part of the print process.
#
# This is called layer because the pdfs used by the client are "layered"
# In these pdfs colors, die cut lines, etc. are sorted into separate layers and can be switched on and off
# That way the it's easy to see which parts affect the print and how

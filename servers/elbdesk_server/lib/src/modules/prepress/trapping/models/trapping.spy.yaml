# Trapping DTO
#
# Trapping is the amount of color that is added to specific parts of an artwork
# Looks similar to a "border" around specific parts to avoid "unprinted" areas between color spaces
# which would happen, because of misalignments of the printing plates
#
# This is used as a descriptive value in the Artwork
# - The actual trapping which is applied to the artwork will happen in the Media Operations process
#
# Google "Trapping Prepress" for more information on the exact process
